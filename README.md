# Back End Systems Design: Questions and Answers Microservice

## Description
Welcome to my Back End Systems Design Project! The purpose of this project is to design a RESTful API (server and database) to provide data to my other project, Patagucci (https://github.com/furtive-falcons/catwalk-website-react/tree/main/client/modules/Reviews). The database contains > 6 million records of user questions and answers data, managed with PostgreSQL, and data is routed through Express to the front end client. 

## Dependencies
* Backend: Node (reverse proxy), Express, NginX (reverse proxy + load balancer), PostgreSQL
* Deployment: AWS EC2, AWS S3, Docker
* Testing: Loader.io, k6
