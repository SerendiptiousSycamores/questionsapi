# Back End Systems Design
### Built with PostgreSQL, Express, NginX, Docker. Deployed on AWS EC2

Welcome to my Back End Systems Design Project! The purpose of this project is to design a RESTful API (server and database) to provide data to my other project, Patagucci. The database contains > 6 million records of user questions and answers data, managed with PostgreSQL, and data is routed through Express to the front end client.
